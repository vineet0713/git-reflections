(start of lesson 3 reflections)

Remote:
allows for syncing data between two repositories
stores the location of a repository that you want to send/receive new commits to/from
operations using remote: push and pull

A remote in your local repository is a reference to another repository

Forking:
allows you to make a copy of an existing repository on GitHub's servers, without pulling to local computer
(it's basically a 'clone' that GitHub makes for you!)

Cloning: it's possible to clone from a remote repository (from GitHub) or from a local repository

When you clone a repository, Git automatically sets up a remote pointing to the cloned repository!

'git pull origin master' is the same as: 'git fetch origin' + 'git merge master origin/master'
(where origin is the remote and master is the branch)

origin/master - (name of remote)/(name of the branch on the specified remote)
